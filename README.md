===================

__Feature-rich server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edition & Windows 10 Edition Beta__

Introduction
-------------
GenisysPro is a server software based on **[Genisys](https://github.com/iTXTech/Genisys)** with extended functionality. Most of the original code was written by **iTXTech**.<br>
Some of the extended functionality that Genisys offers:

* Extended API for plugins (GeniAPI)
* Optional Xbox Live authentication
* Support for Windows 10 Edition Beta

However, Genisys still has a long way to go. We welcome contributions.
